1. What is a gitignore file and what should it include for a Java project?
A gitignore file allows git to know which file or files should be untracked or "ignored" when commiting
and pushing up code to your repository. 

For a basic Java project the below extensions should be included in the gitignore file 
# Compiled class file
*.class

# Log file
*.log

# BlueJ files
*.ctxt

# Mobile Tools for Java (J2ME)
.mtj.tmp/

# Package Files #
*.jar
*.war
*.nar
*.ear
*.zip
*.tar.gz
*.rar

# virtual machine crash logs, see http://www.java.com/en/download/help/error_hotspot.xml

2. What does fast-forward in Git mean?
Fast-forward in git means when you are rebasing or merging against a branch 
that is ahead of the branch that was checked-out. Also the branch that is merging will
contain all the same commits that the branch merging into has.

3. Why should you have different branches?
Having different branches is especially important for version control 
whether you are adding a new feature or fixing a bug in your project, it is better
to create a branch to do these tasks rather than working all in the master branch.
It's also important because if you are working in a team setting, it is important
for all developers to isolate their work from other developers to avoid merge conflicts 
and keep the project more organized in terms of what features each developer is working on.

4. In a project how many remote Git repositories do you usually have?
Typically in a project you have just one Git repository for a project.
